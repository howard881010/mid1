compile the c++ code
push the button A1 is used to decrease the slew by 10 A2 is used to increase the pre_freq by 10 A3 is used to confirm the slew of the wave
compile the python3 code and press user_button to generate the triangle wave
the code FFT.py will output a figure which has two subplots (1) the sampled data we get from the filtered wave (2) the frequency spectrum of the wave we filtered
use picoscope to measure the triangle wave and filter wave
